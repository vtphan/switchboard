## Usage Flow

1. **Startup**: Expert agent connects to Switchboard as a student
2. **Session Discovery**: Finds sessions where the expert is enrolled
3. **Problem Listening**: Waits for instructor problem broadcasts
4. **Hint Generation**: Uses Gemini API to generate contextual hints
5. **Hint Delivery**: Sends hints back to instructors via `instructor_inbox`

## Message Flow

```
Teacher broadcasts problem â†’ Expert receives broadcast â†’ 
Gemini generates hint â†’ Expert sends hint to instructors
```

### Message Types Handled
- **instructor_broadcast** (context: problem) â†’ Generate and send hint
- **instructor_broadcast** (context: status) â†’ Log status update
- **inbox_response** â†’ Log instructor response
- **system** â†’ Handle connection events

### Message Types Sent
- **instructor_inbox** (context: hint) â†’ Send generated hints
- **instructor_inbox** (context: error) â†’ Send error notifications
- **analytics** (context: connection) â†’ Send connection status

## Implementation Differences from Original

- Integrate with external APIs

## Expert Response Examples

Different expert types provide distinct approaches to the same problem:

### Problem: "Find the longest palindromic substring"
**Frustration Level: 3/5** | **Time: 8 minutes**

**Technical Expert** (helpful, direct):
```
"For palindrome detection, consider using the expand-around-centers approach. 
Start with each character as a potential center and expand outwards while 
characters match. This gives you O(nÂ²) time complexity with O(1) space."
```

**Caring Instructor** (nurturing, Socratic):
```
"I can see you've been thinking about this for 8 minutes - that shows good 
persistence! Let me ask you: what makes a palindrome special? If you were 
checking by hand, how would you verify if 'racecar' is a palindrome? 
That intuition might guide your algorithm approach."
```

**Study Buddy** (relatable, peer-to-peer):
```
"Ugh, I remember this problem! I spent like 20 minutes trying to reverse 
every substring ðŸ˜…. Then my classmate showed me this neat trick where you 
treat each letter as the 'middle' of a palindrome and just expand outward. 
Way less confusing than what I was doing!"
```

**Emotional Support Coach** (encouraging, supportive):
```
"I notice you're at a 3/5 frustration level - that's completely normal for 
this type of problem. Take a deep breath. Remember, every expert programmer 
has wrestled with string algorithms. You're not behind; you're exactly 
where you should be in your learning journey."
```

**Algorithm Specialist** (analytical, methodical):
```
"This problem has several algorithmic approaches: brute force O(nÂ³), 
dynamic programming O(nÂ²), or Manacher's algorithm O(n). Given your time 
investment, I'd recommend the expand-around-centers approach as it balances 
efficiency with conceptual clarity."
```

## Integration with Hint-Master System

This Python implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing hint-master architecture:

- **Teacher Client**: Broadcasts problems using JavaScript teacher client
- **Python Experts**: Multiple AI experts provide hints using this implementation
- **Student Interface**: Receives hints through the same WebSocket connections

The experts appear as regular students in the Switchboard system, making them invisible to the underlying infrastructure while providing AI-powered assistance to instructors.
